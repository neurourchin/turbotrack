InterProcess is a fast and compact C library for Windows that allows two processes to access shared memory without collisions. 

InterProcess creates a SharedMemory object that can contain a number of fields of which can have a value. The value of the field can be specified as any data type, whether an int, string or float. 

InterProcess makes it fast and easy to access these shared variables without worrying about collisions or race conditions. 

Under the hood, InterProcess is essentially a fancy wrapper for Window's CreateFileMapping() and MapViewOfFile(). It uses Windows Mutex objects to ensure that only one process can read or write to a field and any given time.
