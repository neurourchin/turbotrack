 *      This includes functions to that call an installed version of MATLAB.
 *      In general MATLAB, has much more higher-level image processing routines than C or OpenCV.
 *      From a programmer's perspective, MATLAB is easier to code. Unfortuantely it is not fast, which is why most
 *      of the OpticalMindControl program is done in OpenCV. Occasionally there are tasks, like image calibration
 *      where time is not critical. In these instances, the image processing work is handed off to MATLAB.
 *
 *      Note that this library also requires openCV, and my custom AndysOpenCVLib.h
